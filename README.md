# QAP4-Insurance
A Python script used to fill out insurance claims, along with using a dollarconvert script that helps change strings into floats and automatically make a printed variable a dollar value.

There are a series of inputs at the beginning of the program, you must respond to them accordingly. There are examples and options, as well as validations for if you input something wrong.

The user can also input a downpayment amount, as well as how many cars and any premiums they may want.

Once done ALL inputs, the program will proceed to print a reciept in the console, and ask if you want to save anything to PastClaims.dat. If "YES", it will save to that file.
